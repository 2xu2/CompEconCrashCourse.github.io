Welcome to the 2024 summer course on computational economics at UMN! It will be a 3-week crash course consisting of 2 Julia and 2 Python lectures each week. The Julia lectures will be taught by Xing Xu and the Python lectures will be taught by Adam Oppenheimer. Find the detailed syllabus and information below. 

All the notebooks for lectures and assignments can be downloaded from [Github repo](https://github.com/CompEconCrashCourse/CompEconCrashCourse.github.io). 

## Introduction

## Schedule

The class will last three weeks from ***June 3rd - June 21st, 2024***. There will be 6 lectures and accompanied problem sets for each language.

Here is the proposed timeline of the lectures.

## Office Hours

We will provide links to sign up for weekly office hours.

## Topics

The courses will have different focuses, with the Julia lectures focusing more on computational methods and their implementations on different types of classic economic models and the Python lectures focusing on programming basics, building up fundamental tools that will culminate in solving simple dynamic programming models. Nevertheless, the classes will be complementary to each other as the skills learned can be applied to any programming languages.

The classes are designed to be introductory, with no prior knowledge on programming required.

### Julia

The 6 Julia lectures are arranged as follows:

### Python
